# Employee-Churn
Data Cleaning, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree


What drives employee turnover among the departments and what is the cost associated with this turnover?  We are aiming to help predict employee churn in a way that allows them to mitigate it and/or anticipate it to allow them to begin the hiring process early and therefore reduce the cost of turnover.  Employee churn is defined as the overall rate at which employees turnover (employees leave and new ones enter).  In the case of this company, they are interested very specifically in voluntary termination - as in an employee choosing to leave without being directed to.
